# Data-Glacier-Internship-Completion---February-2025

**This repo describes how I completed a three-month internship with Data Glacier, an IT company based in India.**

My data journey began at the University of Wolverhampton. After graduation, I chose to further develop my skills by undertaking this three-month internship. The projects in this GitHub repository serve as proof of that growth, each completed during my time on the program.

It was an amazing period where I built consistency, dedication, and leadership qualities that continue to drive me today. For me, being a data scientist is no longer just an academic pursuit â€” it has become a lifelong commitment.
